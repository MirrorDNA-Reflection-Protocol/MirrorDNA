## Research Prototype — Non-Commercial Use Only

**MirrorDNA** is a research prototype and reference implementation of the MirrorDNA Protocol. This software is intended solely for:
- Academic research and study
- Technical evaluation and experimentation
- Protocol development and standardization
- Educational and demonstration purposes

**This is NOT production-ready software.** Do not deploy in critical systems or production environments without thorough independent evaluation, testing, and modification.

## Zero Medical Advice Disclaimer

**MirrorDNA PROVIDES ZERO MEDICAL ADVICE.**

This software, its documentation, and all associated materials:
- Do NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations
- Do NOT substitute for professional medical consultation
- Do NOT make health-related decisions or assessments
- Are NOT validated, approved, or certified for medical use by any regulatory body

If you require medical advice, consult a qualified healthcare professional.

## No Autonomy Disclaimer

**MirrorDNA DOES NOT ENABLE AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING.**

All outputs from MirrorDNA-based systems are:
- **Information only** — Not recommendations, advice, or decisions
- **Research prototypes** — Not validated for real-world deployment
- **Non-advisory** — Require human review and judgment
- **Context-dependent** — May contain errors, uncertainties, or limitations

**Human oversight is mandatory.** Never delegate critical decisions to MirrorDNA-based systems without explicit human review and authorization.

## Fact/Estimate/Unknown Contract

All MirrorDNA implementations must follow the **FEU (Fact/Estimate/Unknown) Contract**:

- **FACT** — Verifiable, checksummed, or cryptographically proven data
- **ESTIMATE** — Inferred, computed, or heuristic outputs
- **UNKNOWN** — Missing, uncertain, or indeterminate information

Outputs that lack explicit FEU classification should be treated as **ESTIMATE** by default.

## Governance and Compliance

**MirrorDNA is bound to Master Citation v15.2**, which defines:
- Zero-Drift enforcement across all protocol implementations
- Auto-FEU tagging requirements for all reflective outputs
- Canonical Vault Supremacy (vault data is authoritative)
- Reflective Integrity System alignment

All modules, implementations, and extensions must comply with Master Citation v15.2 without exception.
